    "### <u> Introduction </u>\n",
    "Tire manufacturing necessitates rigorous quality inspection to ensure product reliability and safety. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to human error. To address these challenges, automated vision-based inspection systems have been explored. This report presents an ongoing research project at T3Lab aimed at developing a vision-based tire inspection system specifically designed for large industrial tires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Project Background </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of ongoing research at T3Lab, aimed at enhancing defect detection in large-scale tire manufacturing. The lab has developed an application, referred to as **Gocator**, to process data from the **Gocator 2350 3D Laser Line Profiler**. The Gocator system converts the acquired data into **.pcd files, 3D images, or point cloud** representations for further analysis. This software, developed by a student from the University of Bologna (Unibo), serves as a fundamental component of the inspection system.\n",

    "### <u> Problem Statement </u>\n",
    "Currently, no computer vision-based systems exist for large tire inspections. The industry relies exclusively on traditional manual inspection methods, which are both inefficient and inconsistent. Therefore, developing an automated defect detection system specifically designed for large tire inspections is crucial. Furthermore, due to hardware constraints, the solution must operate efficiently using only microcontrollers, necessitating the use of **model-based detection** or **traditional image-processing techniques** instead of deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Objective </u>\n",
    "The primary objectives of this research are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Acquisition:** Ensure accurate and reliable data capture from the Gocator 2350 3D Laser Line Profiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inspection System Development:** Develop a vision-based system capable of detecting defects in newly manufactured tires using model-based or traditional detection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Limitations </u>\n",
    "This project operates within the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hardware Limitations:** The system must function exclusively on microcontrollers, precluding the use of deep learning-based neural networks that require GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed Equipment:** The only available hardware includes the Gocator 2350 sensor, its proprietary software, and the conveyor system. No additional hardware modifications or 3D-printed components can be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Conclusion </u>\n",
    "This research aims to develop an efficient vision-based defect detection system for large-scale tire manufacturing. By leveraging the capabilities of the **Gocator 2350 3D Laser Line Profiler** and traditional image-processing techniques, the proposed system will provide a **real-time, non-GPU-based inspection solution** that adheres to industry standards. Future work will focus on **enhancing detection accuracy and optimizing system performance** while operating within the given constraints.\n",

    "\n",
    "### <u> Image Acquisition of the Mold </u>\n",
    "The initial approach involved capturing two images: a reference image of the mold for comparison and images of the manufactured tires. However, due to limitations in the available facilities, proper image acquisition could not be achieved.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Fig 4. Setup for Image Acquisition Available in T3LAB </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Fig. 4, the mold is curved, while the camera remains fixed and the conveyor moves in a single direction. Consequently, the 3D points recorded from the beginning to the end of the mold were insufficient for an effective comparison.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Fig 5. 3D Scan of Mould Collect </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when the acquisition was performed manually, the defective conveyors failed to operate at a constant speed, resulting in image irregularities, as shown in Fig. 5. Although sections (a) and (b) in the image have identical dimensions and depth, the collected point cloud data was highly inaccurate. Furthermore, due to the concave nature of the mold, many critical features at the edges remained obscured, making accurate tire inspection challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Proposed Solution: Camera Rotation Mechanism </u>\n",
    "To overcome this limitation, a rotational mechanism was designed to adjust the camera angle, enabling it to move parallel to the mold’s curvature. The concept is illustrated in Fig. 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Fig. 5, the white curve represents the mold’s curvature, the green curve denotes the camera’s movement path, and the rectangle represents the camera itself. The proposed solution involved using a rotating actuator to achieve accurate image acquisition of the tire mold. A 3D model of the assembly was designed, as shown in Fig. 6, for fabrication via 3D printing. \n",

    "### <u> Challenges In Point Cloud Processing </u>\n",
    "Despite successfully generating the point clouds, several challenges remained. The primary issue was acquisition accuracy. Since the only available acquisition method relied on a conveyor-based scanning system, the resulting **3D scan** did not precisely represent the tire. Minor positional variations on the conveyor led to **dimensional distortions**. Ideally, the scanned tire section should appear as a perfect rectangle; however, repeated scans exhibited **skewing**, resulting in inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This skewing effect is evident in Fig. 13, where the bounding box represents a perfect cuboid, highlighting the misalignment in the scanned geometry.\n",

    "\n",
    "### <u> Traditional Approaches Attempted </u>\n",
    "To address these inconsistencies, several Open3D functions were applied, focusing on translation techniques to align the scan to predefined dimensions. The initial approach involved identifying the corner points of the tire point cloud along the x and y directions. Once identified, the point cloud could be stretched or shrunk to fit the exact rectangular dimensions. This would ensure uniform transformation, bringing the point cloud closer to its ideal shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, detecting the corner points proved to be a significant challenge. After extensive trials and discussions with an academic advisor, it was concluded that traditional model-based techniques were inadequate for this task. The use of a neural network-based approach was considered, but due to the project's constraints—primarily the absence of GPU resources—this approach was deemed impractical. Consequently, the comparison-based detection strategy was abandoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Observations and Proposed Solution </u>\n",
    "Upon further inspection of the point cloud, an important observation was made: all point clouds were generated through a line-wise 3D scanning process. This led to the idea of employing curve fitting techniques as an alternative. Unlike the comparison-based methods, curve fitting does not require complex detection techniques and can effectively achieve the project’s objectives, particularly in detecting defects smaller than a millimeter.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Range:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The range is defined as starting from the minimum y-coordinate (`y_min`) and extending by the specified `range`. The range value was select by trial and observation. The maximum range was chosen just before the next line of points appeared. Empirical analysis determined this range to be **1.5 mm**, as the minimum distance between the first and second lines was observed to be **1.5 mm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A range rather than a single y-value was used due to skewing in the point clouds. As previously discussed, y-values varied between **0.0 to 0.9 mm**, making a range-based approach more reliable for selecting all points belonging to a single scan line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filter Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The function iterates through all points and selects those whose y-coordinates fall within the defined range. This is achieved using a set comprehension for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Subset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The selected points are converted back into a NumPy array and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the selected points form a contiguous line segment along the y-axis, which can then be used for further processing, such as curve fitting or defect detection.\n",

    "The above result table was generated manually, as the code is not capable of detecting the number of defects. Instead, the code only segments and displays the point cloud. The actual number of defects was known beforehand.\n",

    "To evaluate detection accuracy, the number of observed defects was counted by an independent third-party observer—my friend and batchmate, **Santoshkumar**—who had no prior knowledge of the actual defect count. The numbers he recorded reflect the defects he identified in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that **point clouds** or **groups of point clouds** located at the border and appearing red were completely ignored. This was due to **camera noise issues**, which caused height differences between the object’s border and the conveyor belt, leading to **disturbances and false point recordings**. While **outlier removal** could potentially mitigate this issue, it was not applied, as it also removed important defect detection data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the feasibility of detecting defects smaller than **1 mm**, the results indicate that such defects can indeed be identified. Furthermore, by closely examining the point cloud, even the **trademark imprint** on the tire—measuring less than **0.05 mm**—was detected as a defect. This suggests that the proposed technique and setup are capable of detecting both **excess and deficiency defects** as small as **0.05 mm** during manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the **trademark imprint** is not an actual defect, this limitation makes the current solution less than ideal for industrial applications. However, it strongly indicates that the available **camera sensor is highly capable**. The initial concept of **Comparative Defect Detection** could be successfully implemented with proper image acquisition. By scanning a clean mold and comparing it with the manufactured tire—along with applying other **state-of-the-art traditional methods**—a more robust defect detection system could be developed.\n",
